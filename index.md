## About

---

I work at [Formlabs](https://www.formlabs.com) as a software engineer on [Fuse](https://formlabs.com/fuse-1), our SLS 3D
printer. Over the last five years, I have contributed to printer firmware, factory calibration software, print process
optimization, and my largest focus, our print generation pipeline.

I currently specialize in polygon geometry processing
and [laser path planning](https://formlabs.com/blog/sls-speed-sla-build-volume-improvements/#Fuse%201%2B%2030W%20Leads%20the%20SLS%20Category%20With%20New%20Speed%20Improvements).

Before Formlabs, I studied computer science and computer engineering at Clemson University where I focused
on [robotics research](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9812123).

## Publications

> ### 3D Printing of Concrete with a Continuum Robot Hose Using Variable Curvature Kinematics
>
> [IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9812123)
>
> _May 2022_
>
> **Abstract:**
> We present a novel application of continuum robots acting as concrete hoses to support 3D printing of cementitious
> materials. An industrial concrete hose was fitted with a cable harness and remotely actuated via tendons. The
> resulting continuum hose robot exhibited non constant curvature. In order to account for this, a new geometric
> approach to modeling variable curvature inverse kinematics using Euler curves is introduced herein. The new closed
> form model does not impose any additional computational cost compared to the constant curvature model and results in a
> marked improvement in the observed performance. Experiments involving 3D printing with cementitious mortar using a
> continuum hose robot were also conducted.
